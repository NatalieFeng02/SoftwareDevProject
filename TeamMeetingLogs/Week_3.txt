(Questions / Clarifications)
Can have Varsha as contributor for now, but likely make public later

Dont put .env file into the repository (Exposes keys, poor practice)

-- Instead, everyone in group shares an env file (Don't push this)
-- Tell users in README to create their own local .env and how to set get their own ChatGPT API key

If still hesitant on making repo public, email Varsha and Shreesha about this



(Demo)
Main page updated, has dynamic album covers changing on it. Account creation page made but not functional

Search results ordered by relevancy/popularity, results from Spotify. Any results that didn't have lyrics were omitted from search

Clicking on song gives embedded song in top right, song information in top left, lyrics in bottom left, analysis in bottom right

Background page gives Wiki-esque information on song (Songwriting, inspiration, composition, recording info, etc)
-- Historical context, personal anecdotes, reception/impact, performances/alternate versions, controversies/challenges



(Plans for this week)
Might take out ability to save analyses, but likely will still have ability to get as a PDF

Need to work on account login/creation page 

Charles wants to lower the analysis time by either directly streaming the analysis or a loading page
-- Concern that users would click on a new song, page takes a while to load, user assumes its bugged and leaves

May not need connections in site (Low usability)

Improve NAV (Get logo in all pages in nav)

Autofill of "Search for...", has rotating list of artists/songs. Would be under search bar
-- Not an autocomplete, meant to be a visual suggestion

Saving analyses to users (Saving for next week)
-Varsha's suggestion to save one analysis to DB for instant loading, user can request new suggestion and be willing to wait for new analysis

Varsha suggests a friends page to follow friends and share analyses (Key point of multiple interaction between users)

Lyrics.ovh had a day of downtime, concern on reliability and that we can't swap APIs
-- Solution of recording a demo in worst case scenario that API is down on presentation day
---- Need to explain reasoning on demo day why we picked API despite knowing its downtime issue (IF we have issues)
-- Varsha suggested MusixMatch, issues with account registration, costs money
