Minutes:
  - The login/create account/forgot password pages are functional now
  - Showed TA how they are working after navigating from Charles to Lydia's computer
  - We have an "account" page and a "saved analyses" page but neither are functioning yet
  -Discussed how we could have been testing them and need to make sure they work
  - As of right now, the only database we really have is music_db which saves users for 
  login/create account/forget password functionality, so we need some other database to be 
  implemented (friends)
  - Debate over how we can do it and why we did not do it yet
  - The errors we ran into and what was wrong as of right now
  - Need to do manual insert to actually test
  - Figure out a way to get the friends page
  - Decided not to meet again but as a team need to conitnue to meet

Plan:
  - For this week we need to finlize our website and test around for bugs on the website
  - Need to try and implement sharing with friends
      Allow for us to share with other people and use the database
      Get points for actually using the database deeper than login and logout
  - Finalize the logout and account information page (make sure it really works)
  - Have pop ups that say that there is a wrong username or password
  - Prepare presentation
  - Divide up who will present what
  - Practice presetning with one another and get prepared
  - Sign up for a presentation slot
