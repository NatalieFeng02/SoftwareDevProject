We will be using the chatGPT, Lyrics.oph, iTunes (sor song names, artist names, album names, album covers) and Spotify API's (Spotify will be implemented last if time allows).

Other two contributors have to be added to the github to get their points.

This week our main approaches will be getting the register/login page, functionality of GPT & analysis page, databases (Daniel), search function, 

someone will work on postman side of things, another person will work on the page  

havent implemented API's yet, but we have tested them and will be implementing essential API's this week

two main goals: having the login functionality work, and the other is to have the search page working (favorites page/profile page?)

search page: searching song names based on iTunes API and once u click on a song it will get the lyrics using another API

make sure user stories, project boards, etc. done by friday
