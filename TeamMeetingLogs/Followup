Important Features We Plan to Implement:
Analysis of lyrics (stanza by stanza)-- figure out what other kinds of analysis we can do
Log in/Log out (user based)
Save analysis you like on your account
Share analysis between accounts or by converting to .pdf file and sharing
Song previews (short clips we can get from an API)
Making the app profitable/able to break even

Complete by Friday Evening:
Try running or exploring the ChatGPT API
Explore music API (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) for song lyrics and possibly song previews
Finalize the APIs we will be using (do this during team meeting)
Figure out what other kinds of analysis we want to do besides just by stanza (suggested by Varsha)
look into google adsâ€“ explore more of this and decide if we want to move forward with it

We have until Friday evening to decide on these things and update the github repository. Our commits need to include everything we do or update this week.
Saturday morning Varsha will go through our repository and grade us for this week.
Spring Break is next week, but the week after that we will have from Saturday to Friday of each week to complete the work for that week.

Since we are just discussing this week, we will not need very many commits for this project.
